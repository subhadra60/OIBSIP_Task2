        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate web developer with a strong background in front-end and back-end development. I love creating websites and web applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing.</p>

        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="projects.html">Project </a> - The "Temperature Converter" is a web page designed to help users quickly and accurately convert temperature values between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. This user-friendly tool offers a simple and intuitive interface with four key elements:

                Input Field: At the top of the page, users can input the temperature they want to convert. It's important to note that this field is equipped with input validation to ensure that only numerical values are accepted.
                
                Dropdown Menu: Users can choose the unit of measurement for the input temperature by selecting one of the three options from the dropdown menu. They can opt to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, from Fahrenheit to Celsius, or from Kelvin to Celsius.
                
                "Convert" Button: After entering the temperature value and selecting the conversion type, users can click the "Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion process.
                
                Display Area: The final converted temperature, along with its appropriate unit of measurement, is displayed in the designated result area below the "Convert" button. This makes it easy for users to read and understand the converted temperature value.
                
                
            </li>
